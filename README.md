This is a simple calculator for calculating common mathematical operations (version 2).
- The calculator allows you to enter numbers either using the mouse by clicking on buttons in the window, or using the keyboard.
- You can also enter C (Esc), mathematical operations (+-/*), and return (BackSpace) from the keyboard.
- The percentage calculation is based on the result of mathematical operations for all previous calculations.
- The window stores the sequence of mathematical operations, unlike windows calculator.
- The program is implemented on Win32API.
- The meaning of the calculation is to use an array in which even elements are intended to store numbers, and odd elements are for mathematical expressions.
- The calculator takes into account the location where the program was closed and opens it using the old coordinates (file - posWnd.txt).
- The project has four files: main.c, resource.h, resource.rc and iconCalc.ico.
- The user can change the color background until using this app.
- This version solves the problem of displaying real numbers depending on the number of digits after the decimal point.
